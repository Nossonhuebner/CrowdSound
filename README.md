CrowdSound is a SoundCloud inspired webapp. All logged-in users can upload content, view / edit their profile, like tracks, comment on tracks, and follow other users. Users who are not logged in are still able to listen to tracks and view artists.

The backend framework implements Ruby on Rails, with a combination of ActiveStorage and AWS cloud storage to manage user uploads. The frontend uses React.js and Redux to handle state.
